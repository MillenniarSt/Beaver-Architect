## The Aim
Its aim is to simplify and improve every aspect of creating three-dimensional elements starting from more abstract elements up to more concrete elements that will be flexible, easy to use and require less time consumption to create. Particular attention is paid to the aspect of the adaptability of each element to any given space or shape and the possibility of randomizing the generation or modification of each element which makes the application suitable for the creation of video games. Once the world or any other element has been created it will be possible to export it via an architect for the desired system.
